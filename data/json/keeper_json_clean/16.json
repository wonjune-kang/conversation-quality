I can handle online if connection, although I definitely would prefer in person. I think I would be okay with it, to be able to have access to a remote school on the other side of the country without actually having all the costs of moving there and changing one's lifestyle, I think is actually... that would be a gift."

Thank you everybody so much for participating, it was really great to hear about your experiences and your ideas and just hearing about your similarities and differences as well. It's been great talking to you all, I'm sending now the post survey and the chat on Zoom. So you should be able to follow that link and fill out that post survey and then we'll be done. I'll get the Amazon gift cards to you by the end of the week, but if you're experiencing some urgency or need them sooner, feel free to email me and we can figure something out to get that to you as soon as possible. And then once you get that link, you should feel free to hop off the Zoom call. Thank you all so much for participating, it was great talking to you."
