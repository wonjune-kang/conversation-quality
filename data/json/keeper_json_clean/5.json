Then also, I think that it's nice to just use text like Messenger just to send stupid updates and memes as a way of ... On a lower level staying in touch with people. It's a lot less effort. And so yeah, I've been doing that more with friends."

Once you get the link to the post survey, and you click it and start filling it out, you should feel free to leave the Hangout. And today is Friday, so I won't be getting you your amazon gift cards by the end of this week but they should come well before the end of next week. Does that sound okay to everybody?"
