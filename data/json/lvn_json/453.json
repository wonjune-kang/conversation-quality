So hopefully there's things that I can practice and intone today that are helpful and hopefully we can have a kind of smooth experience as much as possible.

And then another opportunity for all of us, we can go to the blue ellipses, rename ourselves, and add our gender pronouns if that's something that we want to do or to model. Just to come across like that. Excellent. Cool. And then the only other thing that I think is really important for virtual spaces is when you're not speaking, it's better to mute because we never know what's happening in our background. And if someone forgets to mute, Jess and I as host can always do that. So just take a peek at your microphone before you start talking to see if you're muted or not or try to mute yourself."

Six, listen generously. So assume good intentions while recognizing that your words have an impact. And then seven, silence all devices including cell phones and smartwatches.

Or, for example, poor connections. These are just kind of things that we want to kind of normalize if they happen and not really let them derail our conversation.

I was trying to land on this, but I want to say generosity in this time where everyone is, a majority of us are having to learn to do with less.

Most of my family, all of my family is in Angola right now. And so even in having like daily conversations with them and being like oceans apart, trying to like figure out how to create that sense of home independently.

I was able to make really good friends and, I had people that were from home that were just very supportive and there for me and someone very special to me came down and visited that weekend when I called her.

People coming up with ways to support our local businesses, urging neighbors to buy gift cards during this time to kind of help tie people over. So that's really giving me a lot of hope.

It went through my son's school. I joke that the elementary schools are just infectious disease wards. [inaudible] I mean they're just gross. So my whole family had the croup go through in November.

Do you think that would help, or is the natural development of community still what we need to go on? You know, this natural cadence, or is there some kind of early thing we can do to build trust and break down this discomfort and those kinds of things? That's a question that I'm leaving with."

I think that also there's ... my experience with in person conversations is that there just tends to be more back and forth because people can give those nonverbal cues that indicates like, \"Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling what you're saying, I'm feeling what you're saying, let me in, coach, let me in.\" They'll just go in. I think that's a little bit trickier, particularly if our recommendation to people is to keep themselves on mute. I think that's one thing that I'm thinking about for the community conversation is, do we actually all want to be on mute? Because I do wonder if by creating just that shared channel, that people might feel a little bit more ... they might kind of jump in a little bit more, I don't know."
